Creating a page templates
=========================

Page template can render content in a straight-forward way: take article delivered to Publisher from Superdesk (or from any other source) and put its elements in markup of your choice (article title in `<h1>`, wrap main body in block-level element, etc).

But page can also be built using *containers* and *widgets* - in that case, editors can change article elements using :doc:`LiveSite Editing tool </manual/editorial_tools/livesite_editor>`.

More on that in our Cookbook Entry :doc:`Complex static pages with Containers and Widgets </cookbooks/templates/complex_static_pages_widgets>`
