Theme Settings
--------------

Settings of a theme are defined in ``theme.json`` configuration file which should be present in every theme directory.

An example of ``theme.json`` file with defined settings will look like:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "name": "swp/default-theme",
        "title": "Default Theme",
        "description": "Superdesk Publisher default theme",
        "authors": [
            {
                "name": "Sourcefabric z.Ãº.",
                "email": "contact@sourcefabric.org",
                "homepage": "https://www.sourcefabric.org",
                "role": "Organization"
            }
        ],
        "settings": {
            "primary_font_family": {
                "label": "Primary Font Family",
                "value": "Roboto",
                "type": "string",
                "help": "The primary font"
            },
            "secondary_font_family": {
                "value": "Roboto",
                "type": "string"
            },
            "body_font_size": {
                "label": "Body Font Size",
                "value": 14,
                "type": "integer"
            }
        }
    }

In the ``settings`` property of the JSON file are defined the default theme's settings.

Each setting can be overridden by the API. See ``/settings/`` API endpoint for more details in the ``/api/doc`` route
in your Superdesk Publisher instance.

Read more about settings in :doc:`Settings </bundles/SWPSettingsBundle/settings_definitions>` chapter to find out more.

Every setting is a JSON object which can contain the following properties:
- ``label`` - Setting's label, will be visible in API when defined,
- ``value`` - Setting's value, will be visible in API when defined,
- ``type`` - Setting's type, either it's ``string``, ``integer``, ``boolean`` or ``array``.
- ``help`` - Settins's helper text.

How to display theme's settings in templates?
`````````````````````````````````````````````

.. code-block:: twig

    {# app/themes/<tenant_code>/<theme_name>/views/index.html.twig #}
    {{ themeSetting('primary_font_family') }} # will print "Roboto"

If the theme's setting doesn't exists an exception will be thrown with a proper message that it does not exist.
