Introduction
============

Why choose Publisher?
---------------------

If your organisation already creates and produces content in Superdesk, Publisher is built to work with it natively. If not, but your back-end system or systems are still fit for purpose and your need is to manage a portfolio of digital assets (from multiple websites to apps to social feeds), Superdesk Publisher can be integrated with your legacy tools until their deprecation and replacement.


What is Publisherâ€™s focus?
--------------------------

- Efficient content delivery to multiple digital channels.
- Rapid development of new website and digital layouts, independently from back-end systems to avoid disrupting editorial workflows.
- All the latest embeds and custom widgets for your web pages.
- Full commercial support from the upstream development and implementation teams.

    ExampleTheme/               <=== Theme starts here
        views/                  <=== Views directory
            article.html.twig
            base.html.twig
            category.html.twig
            home.html.twig
        translations/           <=== Translations directory
            messages.en.xlf
            messages.de.xlf
        public/                 <=== Assets directory
            css/
            js/
            images/
        theme.json              <=== Theme configuration
