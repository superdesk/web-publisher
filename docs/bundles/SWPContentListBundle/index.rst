ContentListBundle
=================

This bundle gives you an ability to create powerful content lists where lists' items can be of any type.
For example, imagine a list which contains a lot of articles which you can add, reorder, drag and drop etc.

:doc:`/components/ContentList/index`, which is used by this bundle, provides classes to build powerful
 and flexible content lists.
