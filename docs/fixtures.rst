Fixtures Bundle
================

Overview
--------

Fixtures Bundle helps developers to create fixtures/fake data that can be
used for the development or/and testing purposes.

It relies on the following 3rd party libraries: -
`DoctrineFixturesBundle`_ (gives possibility to load data fixtures
programmatically into the Doctrine ORM or ODM) - `fzaninotto/Faker`_
(generates fake data for you) - `nelmio/alice`_ (It gives you a few
essential tools to make it very easy to generate complex data with
constraints in a readable and easy to edit way)

It also gives the possibility to setup, ready to use demo theme, needed
for the development.

How to use it
==============

The following chapter describes how to make use of the Fixtures Bundle features.

Creating a simple PHP fixture class
-----------------------------------

Fixtures should be created inside
``SWP\FixturesBundle\DataFixtures\<db_driver>`` directory and for the
convention, should be called like: ``LoadPagesData``,
``LoadArticlesData``, ``LoadUsersData`` etc.

Replace ``db_driver`` either with ``ORM`` for the Doctrine ORM or
``PHPCR`` for the Doctrine PHPCR ODM.

Example Fixture class:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    namespace SWP\FixturesBundle\DataFixtures\ORM;

    use Doctrine\Common\DataFixtures\FixtureInterface;
    use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager;
    use SWP\FixturesBundle\AbstractFixture;

    class LoadPagesData extends AbstractFixture implements FixtureInterface
    {
        /**
         * {@inheritdoc}
         */
        public function load(ObjectManager $manager)
        {
            $env = $this->getEnvironment();
            $this->loadFixtures(
                '@SWPFixturesBundle/Resources/fixtures/ORM/'.$env.'/page.yml',
                $manager
            );
        }
    }

Each fixture class extends AbstractFixture class and implements
FixtureInterface, this way we can use ``load`` method, inside which we
can create some objects using PHP and/or make use of `nelmio/alice`_ and
`fzaninotto/Faker`_ by loading fixtures in YAML format, as shown in the
example above.

Creating a simple Alice fixture (YAML format)
---------------------------------------------

For more details on how to create Alice fixtures, please see
`documentation`_ as a reference.

Example Alice fixture:

.. code-block:: yaml

    SWP\WebRendererBundle\Entity\Page:
        page1:
            name: "About Us"
            type: 1
            slug: "about-us"
            templateName: "static.html.twig"
            contentPath: "/swp/content/about-us"
        page2:
            name: "Features"
            type: 1
            slug: "features"
            templateName: "features.html.twig"
            contentPath: "/swp/content/features"
        page3:
            name: "Get Involved" # we can also use faker library formatters like: <paragraph(20)> etc
            type: 1
            slug: "get-involved"
            templateName: "involved.html.twig"
            contentPath: "/swp/content/get-involved"

The above configuration states that we want to persist into database,
three objects of type ``SWP\WebRendererBundle\Entity\Page``. We can use faker `formatters`_
where, for example, ``<paragraph(20)>`` is one of the
`fzaninotto/Faker`_ formatter, which tells Alice to generate 20
paragraphs filled with fake data.

For the convention, Alice YAML files should be placed inside
``Resources/fixtures/<db_driver>/<environment>``, where is current
environment name (dev, test).

For instance, having ``Resources/fixtures/ORM/test/page.yml`` Alice
fixture, we will be able to persist fake data defined in YAML file into
the databse (using Doctrine ORM driver), only when ``test`` environment
is set or defined differently in
``SWP\FixturesBundle\DataFixtures\ORM\LoadPagesData.php``.

There is a lot of flexibility on how to define fixtures, so itâ€™s up to
developer how to create them.

Loading all fixtures
---------------------------------------------

**Note:** Remember to update your database schema before loading
fixtures! To do it, run in terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console doctrine:schema:update --force
    $ php app/console doctrine:phpcr:repository:init

Once you have your fixtures defined, we can simply load them. To do that
you must execute console commands in terminal:

To load Doctrine ORM fixtures:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console doctrine:fixtures:load --append
    # see php app/console doctrine:fixtures:load --help for more details

To load Doctrine PHCR fixtures:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console doctrine:phpcr:fixtures:load
    # see php app/console doctrine:phpcr:fixtures:load --help for more details

After executing above commands, your database will be filled with the
fake data, which can be used by themes.

Setting up demo theme
---------------------------------------------

To make it easier to start with the WebPublisher, we created a simple
demo theme. To set this theme as an active one, you need to execute the
following console command in terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console theme:setup
    # see php app/console theme:setup --help for more details
