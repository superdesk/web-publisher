Most popular (read) articles list
=================================

Article meta have property :code:`articleStatistics` and inside it You can find :code:`pageViewsNumber`. To simplify
syntax for ordering we created :code:`pageViews` alias.

Here is example how to order articles by their page views number:

.. code-block:: twig

    {% gimmelist article from articles|order('pageViews', 'desc') %} <!-- ordering by page views -->
        <a href="{{ url(article) }}">{{ article.title }}</a>
    {% endgimmelist %}

To activate article page views counting you need to call short twig function.

.. code-block:: twig

    {{ countPageView(gimme.article) }}

It will print :code:`<script>` tag with some generated by Publisher javascript code inside.
