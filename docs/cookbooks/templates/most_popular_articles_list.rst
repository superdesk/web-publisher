Most popular (read) articles list
=================================

Article meta have property :code:`articleStatistics` and inside it You can find :code:`pageViewsNumber`. To simplify
syntax for ordering we created :code:`pageViews` alias.

Here is example how to order articles by their page views number:

.. code-block:: twig

    {% gimmelist article from articles|order('pageViews', 'desc') %} <!-- ordering by page views -->
        <a href="{{ url(article) }}">{{ article.title }}</a>
    {% endgimmelist %}


There is also option to get most popular (ordered by page views) articles from date range.

For example this is how You can list yesterday most popular articles:

.. code-block:: twig

    {% gimmelist article from articles|order('pageViews', 'desc')|dateRange('now', '-1 day') %}
        <a href="{{ url(article) }}">{{ article.title }}</a>
    {% endgimmelist %}


Filter :code:`dateRange` takes two parameters compatible with PHP strtotime syntax (http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php):

  - start date (<= equal or in past ) - time will be reset to 23:59:59
  - end date (>= equal or in feature) - time will be reset to 00:00:00

So :code:`|dateRange('now', '-1 day')` will filter all page views from whole day today and whole yesterday (from midnight)

To activate article page views counting you need to call short twig function.

.. code-block:: twig

    {{ countPageView(gimme.article) }}

It will print :code:`<script>` tag with some generated by Publisher javascript code inside.
