Feature: Reprocessing already send to publisher packages
  In order to apply new rules or content modifications to already pushed to publisher packages
  As a console command
  I want to be able to pick and reprocess packages

  Scenario: Reprocessing packages with commands:
    Given the following Tenants:
      | organization | name | code   | subdomain | domain_name | enabled | default |
      | Default      | test | 123abc |           | localhost   | true    | true    |
