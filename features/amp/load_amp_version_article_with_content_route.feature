Feature: Rendering AMP HTML version of the content assigned to route of type "content"
  In order to render AMP HTML version of of content with route of type "content"
  As a HTTP Client
  I want to be able to see the valid AMP HTML page

  Scenario: Change route template
    Given I am authenticated as "test.user"
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
    And I send a "POST" request to "/api/v1/content/routes/" with body:
     """
      {
        "route": {
          "name": "Contact",
          "slug": "contact",
          "type": "content"
        }
      }
    """
    Then the response status code should be 201
    And the JSON node "id" should be equal to "7"

    And I am authenticated as "test.user"
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
    And I send a "PATCH" request to "/api/v1/tenants/123abc" with body:
     """
      {
        "tenant": {
          "ampEnabled": true
        }
      }
    """
    Then the response status code should be 200

    And I am authenticated as "test.user"
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
    And I send a "POST" request to "/api/v1/content/push" with body:
