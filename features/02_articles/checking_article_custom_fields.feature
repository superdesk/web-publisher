Feature: Validating if article slugline is created out of the package headline
  when slugline metadata is is not present in request payload.
  In order to publish an article and access it via slug
  As a HTTP Client
  I want to be able to check if the article slug was generated properly

  Scenario: Submitting and publishing a package with extra custom fields
    Given I am authenticated as "test.user"
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
    And I send a "POST" request to "/api/{version}/content/push" with body:
