Feature: Collect article statistics
  In order to work with article statistics
  As a HTTP Client
  I want to be able to count page views and see them in API

  Scenario: Opening article page
    When I go to "/news/test-news-article"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And I should see "/_swp_analytics?articleId=1'+request_randomizer+'&ref='+document.referrer"

  Scenario: Send analytics request
    When I go to "/_swp_analytics?articleId=1"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the header "terminate-immediately" should be equal to "1"

  Scenario: Running article events consumer
    When I run "rabbitmq:consumer analytics_event -v" command for 3 seconds

  Scenario: Send analytics impressions request
    When I send a POST request to "/_swp_analytics?type=impression&15362257892160.335822969944755" with body:
    """
["http://localhost/news/test-news-article"]
    """
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the header "terminate-immediately" should be equal to "1"

    When I am authenticated as "test.user"
    And I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
    Then I send a "GET" request to "/api/v1/content/articles/test-news-article"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the JSON nodes should contain:
      | slug                                | test-news-article |
      | articleStatistics.pageViewsNumber   | 22                |
      | articleStatistics.internalClickRate | 1                 |
