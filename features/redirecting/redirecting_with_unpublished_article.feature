Feature: Reprocessing already send to publisher packages
  In order to apply new rules or content modifications to already pushed to publisher packages
  As a console command
  I want to be able to pick and reprocess packages

  Scenario: Reprocessing packages with commands:
    Given the following Tenants:
      | organization | name | code   | subdomain | domain_name | enabled | default |
      | Default      | test | 123abc |           | localhost   | true    | true    |

    Given the following organization publishing rule:
    """
      {
        "name":"Test rule",
        "description":"Test rule description",
        "priority":1,

            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    """

    Given the following Routes:
      |  name | type       | slug |
      |  test | collection | test |

    Given the following tenant publishing rule:

    Given the following Package ninjs:

    Then I send a "GET" request to "/redirecting/extra/articleNumber/1"
    Then the response status code should be 301
    And the header "location" should contain "http://localhost/test/test-package"

    Then I send a "GET" request to "http://localhost/test/test-package"
    Then the response status code should be 200

    Then I send a "GET" request to "http://localhost/test/test-package-wrong"
    Then the response status code should be 301
    And the header "location" should contain "http://localhost/test"

    When I am authenticated as "test.user"
    And I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
    Then I send a "PATCH" request to "/api/v2/content/articles/1" with body:
     """
      {
          "status": "unpublished"

    Then the response status code should be 301
