Feature: Checking if package corrections work fine
  In order to correct a package
  As a HTTP Client
  I want to be able to check if submitted request is processed correctly

  Scenario: Package status is not updated after the correction
    And the current date time is "2021-03-08 10:22"
    Given I am authenticated as "test.user"
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
    And I send a "POST" request to "/api/v2/content/push" with body:
