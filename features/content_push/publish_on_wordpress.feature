Feature: Checking if pushed package will be published on tenant with output channel set to Wordpress
  In order to process content push
  As a HTTP Client
  I want to be able to check if request is processed and forwarded correctly

  Scenario: Publishing content to tenant with wordpress configured as a output channel.
    Given I am authenticated as "test.user"
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
    And I send a "PATCH" request to "/api/v1/tenants/123abc" with body:
     """
      {
        "tenant": {
          "outputChannel": {
