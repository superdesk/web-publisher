Feature: Set article's published at datetime from package's firstpublished property
  In order set a past publish date
  As a HTTP Client
  I want to be able to push JSON content which has firstpublished's value set to past date.

  Scenario: Publish content with firstpublished property set
    Given I am authenticated as "test.user"
    And the current date time is "2019-03-10 09:00"
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
    And I send a "PATCH" request to "/api/{version}/settings/" with body:
    """
    {
      "settings": {
        "name":"use_first_published_as_publish_date",
        "value":true
      }
    }
    """
    Then the response status code should be 200

    Then I am authenticated as "test.user"
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
    And I send a "POST" request to "/api/v1/content/push" with body:
    """
