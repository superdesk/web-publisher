Feature: Manage Routes
  In order to work with routes
  As a HTTP Client
  I want to be able to manage them by API

  Scenario: Listing existing routes
    Given I am authenticated as "test.user"
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
    And I send a GET request to "/api/v1/content/routes/"
