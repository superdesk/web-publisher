Feature: Manage Routes
  In order to work with routes
  As a HTTP Client
  I want to be able to manage them by API

  Scenario: Listing existing routes
    Given I am authenticated as "test.user"
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
    And I send a GET request to "/api/v1/content/routes/"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the JSON node total should be equal to 5

  Scenario: Creating new route with custom slug
    Given I am authenticated as "test.user"
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
    And I send a "POST" request to "/api/v1/content/routes/" with body:
     """
      {
        "route": {
          "name": "Simple test route",
          "slug": "simple-test-route",
          "type": "collection",
          "content": null
        }
      }
    """
    Then the response status code should be 201
    And the JSON node name should be equal to "Simple test route"
    And the JSON node slug should be equal to "simple-test-route"
    And the JSON node staticPrefix should be equal to "/simple-test-route"

  Scenario: Creating new route without custom slug
    Given I am authenticated as "test.user"
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
    And I send a "POST" request to "/api/v1/content/routes/" with body:
     """
      {
        "route": {
          "name": "Simple test route number 2",

    And the JSON node slug should be equal to "simple-test-route-number-2"
    And the JSON node staticPrefix should be equal to "/simple-test-route-number-2"


  Scenario: Creating new route with parent and removing parent
    Given I am authenticated as "test.user"
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"

    """
    Then the response status code should be 201

    And the JSON node level should be equal to 0

    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"

  Scenario: Creating new route without type custom
    Given I am authenticated as "test.user"
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
    And I send a "POST" request to "/api/v1/content/routes/" with body:
